        <h1>Hi, it's Kirti!</h1>
        <p>
          All about the 70’s Bollywood bangers, trying to make the world a little greener (one sustainable choice at a time), and finding stillness in meditation.
          Only peace, no pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Believing in the quiet power of connection and loving the people around me, even if they don’t always get my music taste.
          Powered by the heart and questionable dance moves, also maybe some good coffee :))
